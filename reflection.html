  <h1>Reflection </h1>
  <p>This project started as a case study for Race and Technologies of Surveillance in Spring 2022. I chose to study TikTok because of both my personal interest (I spend way too much time on TikTok) and its connections to class content. </p>

  <p>Yet, when I began researching TikTok, I realized that there wasn’t a lot of information out there about TikTok’s surveillance and racial implications. Unlike Facebook/Twitter/Instagram or any of the other major social media sites that are out there, TikTok has only gained popularity over the past few years, notably gaining traction during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. As a result, there appears to be much less scholarship specifically focused on TikTok as a technology, and information that does exist is mostly limited, anecdotal, not systematic, and focused on a particular aspect of race or surveillance and not many things together. </p>

  <p>Given this, I wanted to create a body of work that discusses these topics in more detail in one cohesive piece. My specific areas of interest were the algorithm and how that involves issues of profitability, privacy, and popularity, how race and visibility play into opportunities on the app and beyond, and finally the ways that creators have responded to this system. </p>

  <p>While this is by no means a complete study, it is intended to generate questions about how TikTok functions, how TikTok impacts creators — specifically creators of color — and how TikTok continues systems of oppression. </p>

  <p>If there’s anything I’ve learned throughout this class (and other CDT classes I have taken this last year), it’s that <b> technologies have politics embedded into them,</b> and that those technologies impact people differently and disproportionately as a result of their design. Of course, the result of learning that technologies have politics should not be to say that we need to stop creating or using technology. Instead, it should prompt us to ask how we can make our world better. </p>

  <p>Instead of  designing “technology for good,” <b>what does it mean to design systems in a way to be just and equitable with the goal of co-liberation?</b> How can our work allow us to examine and challenge power or rethink binaries and hierarchies? How can we use design to empower communities and seek liberation from oppressive systems?</p>

  <p>We clearly need more perspectives and more research about how we use technology and how it reinforces oppression — including TikTok — not less. Asking questions about how it is made, used, and its impacts is a good place to start.</p>
